Date: 2018-12-01

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Using once shell file makes for one very big complicated file
Using smaller self contained files means new developers can more easily make useful changes and adding new files has less risk

## Decision

Each file should do one thing and do it well 

## Consequences

Its easier to add new features
